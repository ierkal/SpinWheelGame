Wheel of Fortune game made in Unity 2021.3.45f2 version.

To run game, please go to Master scene and start the game from there.

* Used google sheet baking for items. It directly creates the item data and pushes into ScriptableObject. 
* But due to public repository; google disabled the service key and blocking new imports from the unity project from now on.
* Item data is created in the project already so it won't affect its state.

Here is the google sheet:
